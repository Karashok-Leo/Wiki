# Enchantment Infusion

## 🪄Introduction

This mod adds a directional enchanting method, inspired by the Enchanting Apparatus recipes from [Ars Nouveau](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau).

### How to enchant ?

Two new blocks have been added to: the Enchantment Infusion Table and the Enchantment Infusion Pedestal. Use item to right-click them to put it in, and empty-handed right-click to remove item from them.

You need to place an enchantment infusion table (centre position) and enchantment infusion pedestals (surrounding position) like the picture below, then place the corresponding items on the pedestals according to the recipe (the order doesn't matter), and finally place the item you want to enchant on the infusion table in the centre, and wait for seconds for it to finish enchanting.
